0. Cover slide for screen before talk: a "beautiful destination" picture chosen by neural net?

1. Intro - me, BD. contact details.
 - not talk too much about BD specifically because my talk is more about the more general things I've encountered,
   though there will be some details about what we do in the talk because its not secret secret.

2. describing existing processes in shake

The environment when I arrived:
 * core haskell product built by Makefile and deployed via apt
 * python based projects - history of experimental data analysis rather 
   than production code. some of this needed to become production,
   so wanted things like productible builds.
 * other projects appearing ad-hoc

Note that this isn't intended to be some canonical use of Shake - 
it's how it seemed to me to be a (not the) right way to do it.

Two uses of shake:

 *  the small one:
   took a small piece of the Makefile which was awkward and
   replaced it with shake.

  TODO: show the old code
  What was awkward about this?

  What couldn't we express in Make that we can express in shake?
  How did we express this in shake? 
    - show shake code
    - how it fits into Makefile - have to build shake each time or
       require it as a pre-req. this is cached though.

 * bigger use:
    building everything.
    on the TODO list to do "something" for a long time, but
     catalyst was new junior sys admin starting and me having
     to explain our processes - I decided I'd rather write it
     down in machine readable form rather than English.

    what are the kinds of things we're building?
      - debian packages
      - docker images
      - test "certifications" - describe this later

    this only happened in the last few weeks. payoffs so far:
      devs can build "official" style production releases on
      their machines. can re-use parts of CI/production infrastrucutre
      to stand up fuller test environments on their local
      machines.
   part of move towards a mono-repo -  change some docker file
     because we need a different compiler, for example, and
     we can version that together with the code that needs
     the different compiler (the monorepo part) and we can
     build without too much redundancy

   test certifications - track which tests have run (at a
     big-chunk scale - because eg don't stand up a new DB every
     
     ) 

3. ghcjs vs ghc
     - generally very good
     - #ifdef build ickiness that I think can be
       entirely replaced - see my comment: 
       https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/56ucmt/how_do_you_structure_web_projects_that_share/d8n6xcj/
         - Functor style types - an interesting variation on the "what text type to use?"
         - poor use of #ifdef to simulate files.

     - move away from talking about a "frontend" and a "backend" - it's
       single application running in a distributed environment where
       some components have one runtime and others have a different runtime.
        - version together, code together.

     - spock+json to communicate - *BUT* this is not an "API"
        - move to shoving haskell data values around that are "command" objects
       . we serialise to JSON but
       we could serialise to anything. JSON is historical and
       I don't personally feel a huge pressure to move away from
       but it's not a core thing: most of our JSON is derive Generic,
       and we could derive another format.
       There is no "API" spec - these are communications within the
         same version of the app and by definition (or by type checking ;)
         will work together.

(aside:
     - separately there's a lot of REST-ish API interactions: 
        - we talk to third party services like facebook/instagram, openstreetmap
        - python/haskell components communicate over HTTP
)

4. database testing / postgres subset tool

  - tool that didn't do what I want - take a big DB and
     output some subset of it that can be restored fast.
  - two kinds of fixpoints: SQL fixpoints - there is "expanding" sql fixpoint stuff but not "shrinking" style
                            Haskell mdo fixpoint - recursive value but need to grab information from other sources when doing it - from the config file for eg. overridden foreign keys, and from the database itself
  - url - "public" but no licence so you can't really use it. would like to fix that.
  - database subsetting as testing tool: giving a different database to the
    app that is not the mega-production-app database. so it should work. but sometimes
    it doesn't.
